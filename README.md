# Quickquiz
QuickQuiz is a web-based learning tool created to make it easier for students to  understand fundamental Computer Science (CS) concepts by using interesting and  interactive tests. This project's main goal is to assist students in reinforcing basic ideas in 
an environment that is self-paced and assessment-driven. QuickQuiz is a targeted tool for academic revision, and idea clarification in light of the increasing need for solid 
fundamental knowledge in fields like Java, Python, Machine Learning, Operating Systems, DBMS, and Computer Architecture.
It offers carefully selected multiple-choice tests in a range of technical fields. Every question is intended to foster conceptual comprehension in addition to testing factual knowledge. The platform improves the user's learning experience by offering immediate feedback and explanations once the user selects an answer. In order to encourage motivation and engagement, the quiz format also incorporates elements like retrying 
questions after unsuccessful tries and celebration animations (like confetti effects) for right answers.
